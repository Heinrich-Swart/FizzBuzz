The code is a common problem that is asked within an interview to test your basic knowledge of python. The code asks for any number, and then the code runs from 1 to your number. When something is dividable by 3, it says fizz and when it is diviable by 5 it says Buzz. But when the number is dividable by 3 and 5, the program says fizzbuzz.
